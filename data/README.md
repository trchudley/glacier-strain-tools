These velocity data cover a region of the West Greenland Ice Sheet from Store Glacier to Perlefiup Sermia. The data and region of interest are the same as that of Chudley _et al._ (2021). The _vx_ and _vy_ fields provided are 2018 annual velocity fields from the _MEaSUREs Greenland Annual Ice Sheet Velocity Mosaics from SAR and Landsat_ dataset, available from the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (https://doi.org/10.5067/OBXCG75U7540; Joughin, 2010).
